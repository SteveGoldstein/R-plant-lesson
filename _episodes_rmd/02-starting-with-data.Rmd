## Presentation of the Workshop Data

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Presentation of the workshop data
```
In this workshop, we will be working with two sets of data: one is the
`iris` data  from the classic paper by Fisher (ref?  1934?) and the
other is from a recent paper on ??? by OKeefe and Nippert (ref).  Each dataset is stored
as comma separated value (CSV) file.

The `iris` data have morphological measures from more than 100 samples of 3 species of irises.
Each row holds information for a single sample (plant?  specimen?), and the columns represent:



| Column          |  Description               |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| sepal\_length   |  are these in cm or inch?  |
| sepal\_width    |  what should we write for  |
| petal\_length   |  description?
| petal\_width    |
| species         |  ...?

<!-- maybe we should get rid of the table and just say the columns are
... measurements (in units) of sepal and petal lengths and widths, and
the species  --> 

We are going to use the R function `download.file()` to download the CSV file
that contains the survey data from figshare, and we will use `read.csv()` to
load into memory the content of the CSV file as an object of class `data.frame`. 
Inside the download.file command, the first entry is a character string with the source URL 
<!-- URL??  -->
("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169"). This source URL downloads a CSV file from 
figshare. The text after the comma ("data/iris.csv") is the destination of the 
file on your local machine. You'll need to have a folder on your machine called "data" where 
you'll download the file. So this command downloads a file from figshare, names it 
"iris.csv," and adds it to a preexisting folder named "data."


```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
download.file(url="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files????",
              destfile = "data/iris.csv")
```

You are now ready to load the data:

```{r, eval=TRUE,  purl=FALSE}
iris <- read.csv("data/iris.csv")
```

This statement doesn't produce any output because, as you might recall,
assignments don't display anything. If we want to check that our data has been
loaded, we can see the contents of the data frame by typing its name: `iris`.

Wow... that was a more than a screenful of output.
Let's check the top (the first 6 lines) of this data frame using the
function `head()`:

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
head(iris)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
## Try also
View(iris)
```

> ### Note

## What are data frames?

Data frames are the _de facto_ data structure for most tabular data, and what we
use for statistics and plotting.

A data frame can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by the
functions `read.csv()` or `read.table()`; in other words, when importing
spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web).

A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the
columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because columns are
vectors, each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers,
factors). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising a
numeric, a character, and a logical vector.

![](/fig/data-frame.svg)


We can see this when inspecting the <b>str</b>ucture of a data frame
with the function `str()`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
str(iris)
```

## Inspecting `data.frame` Objects

We already saw how the functions `head()` and `str()` can be useful to check the
content and the structure of a data frame. Here is a non-exhaustive list of
functions to get a sense of the content/structure of the data. Let's try them out!

* Size:
    * `dim(iris)` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element,
          and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of
          the object)
    * `nrow(iris)` - returns the number of rows
    * `ncol(iris)` - returns the number of columns

* Content:
    * `head(iris)` - shows the first 6 rows
    * `tail(iris)` - shows the last 6 rows

* Names:
    * `names(iris)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for `data.frame`
	   objects)
    * `rownames(iris)` - returns the row names

* Summary:
    * `str(iris)` - structure of the object and information about the class, length and
	   content of  each column
    * `summary(iris)` - summary statistics for each column

Note: most of these functions are "generic", they can be used on other types of
objects besides `data.frame`.


> ### Challenge
>
> Based on the output of `str(iris)`, can you answer the following questions?
>
> * What is the class of the object `iris`?
> * How many rows and how many columns are in this object?
> * How many species have been recorded during these iris?
>
> ```{r, answer=TRUE, results="markup", purl=FALSE}

> ## * how many rows: 150,  how many columns: 5
> ## * how many species: 3
>
> ```


```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}

## Challenge
## Based on the output of `str(iris)`, can you answer the following questions?
## * What is the class of the object `iris`?
## * How many rows and how many columns are in this object?
## * How many species have been recorded during these iris?

```



## Indexing and subsetting data frames

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}

## Indexing and subsetting data frames
```


Our survey data frame has rows and columns (it has 2 dimensions), if we want to
extract some specific data from it, we need to specify the "coordinates" we
want from it. Row numbers come first, followed by column numbers. However, note
that different ways of specifying these coordinates lead to results with
different classes.


```{r, purl=FALSE}
# first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)
iris[1, 1]   
# first element in the 3rd column (as a vector)
iris[1, 3]   
# first column of the data frame (as a vector)
iris[, 1]    
# first column of the data frame (as a data.frame)
iris[1]      
# first three elements in the 4th column (as a vector)
iris[1:3, 4] 
# the 3rd row of the data frame (as a data.frame)
iris[3, ]    
# equivalent to head_iris <- head(iris)
head_iris <- iris[1:6, ] 
```

`:` is a special function that creates numeric vectors of integers in increasing
or decreasing order, test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance.

You can also exclude certain indices of a data frame using the "`-`" sign:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
iris[, -1]          # The whole data frame, except the first column
iris[-c(7:150), ] # Equivalent to head(iris)
```

Data frames can be subset by calling indices (as shown previously), but also by calling their column names directly:

```{r, eval = FALSE, purl=FALSE}
iris["species"]       # Result is a data.frame
iris[, "species"]     # Result is a vector
iris[["species"]]     # Result is a vector
iris$species          # Result is a vector
```

In RStudio, you can use the autocompletion feature to get the full and correct names of the columns.

## Factors

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
### Factors
```

When we did `str(iris)` we saw that four of the columns consist of
numbers. The column `species`, ... however, is
of a special class called `factor`. Factors are very useful and actually
contribute to making R particularly well suited to working with data. So we are
going to spend a little time introducing them.

Factors represent categorical data. They are stored as integers associated with labels and they can be ordered or unordered. While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually treated as integer vectors by R. So you need to be very careful when treating them as strings.

Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values, known as
*levels*. By default, R always sorts levels in alphabetical order. For
instance, if you have a factor with 2 levels:

<!-- should we have a factor like monicot and dicot or coniferous and decidous? -->
```{r, purl=TRUE}
sex <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male"))
```

R will assign `1` to the level `"female"` and `2` to the level `"male"` (because
`f` comes before `m`, even though the first element in this vector is
`"male"`). You can see this by using the function `levels()` and you can find the
number of levels using `nlevels()`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
levels(sex)
nlevels(sex)
```

Sometimes, the order of the factors does not matter, other times you might want
to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., "low", "medium", "high"),
it improves your visualization, or it is required by a particular type of
analysis. Here, one way to reorder our levels in the `sex` vector would be:

```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
sex # current order
sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("male", "female"))
sex # after re-ordering
```

In R's memory, these factors are represented by integers (1, 2, 3), but are more
informative than integers because factors are self describing: `"female"`,
`"male"` is more descriptive than `1`, `2`. Which one is "male"?  You wouldn't
be able to tell just from the integer data. Factors, on the other hand, have
this information built in. It is particularly helpful when there are many levels
(like the species names in our example dataset).

### Converting factors

If you need to convert a factor to a character vector, you use
`as.character(x)`.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
as.character(sex)
```

In some cases, you may have to convert factors where the levels appear as
numbers (such as concentration levels or years) to a numeric vector. For
instance, in one part of your analysis the years might need to be encoded as
factors (e.g., comparing average weights across years) but in another part of
your analysis they may need to be stored as numeric values (e.g., doing math
operations on the years). This conversion from factor to numeric is a little
trickier. The `as.numeric()` function returns the index values of the factor,
not its levels, so it will result in an entirely new (and unwanted in this case)
set of numbers. One method to avoid this is to convert factors to characters,
and then to numbers.

Another method is to use the `levels()` function. Compare:

```{r, purl=TRUE}
year_fct <- factor(c(1990, 1983, 1977, 1998, 1990))
as.numeric(year_fct)               # Wrong! And there is no warning...
as.numeric(as.character(year_fct)) # Works...
as.numeric(levels(year_fct))[year_fct]    # The recommended way.
```

Notice that in the `levels()` approach, three important steps occur:

* We obtain all the factor levels using `levels(year_fct)`
* We convert these levels to numeric values using `as.numeric(levels(year_fct))`
* We then access these numeric values using the underlying integers of the
  vector `year_fct` inside the square brackets

### Renaming factors

When your data is stored as a factor, you can use the `plot()` function to get a
quick glance at the number of observations represented by each factor
level. Let's look at the number of males and females captured over the course of
the experiment:

```{r, purl=TRUE}
## bar plot of the number of females and males captured during the experiment:
plot(iris$species)
```

<!--  should we just leave this out and do something else here?  -->
<!-- introduce the other dataset?      -->

In addition to males and females, there are about 1700 individuals for which the
sex information hasn't been recorded. Additionally, for these individuals,
there is no label to indicate that the information is missing or undetermined. Let's rename this
label to something more meaningful. Before doing that, we're going to pull out
the data on sex and work with that data, so we're not modifying the working copy
of the data frame:

```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
sex <- iris$sex
head(sex)
levels(sex)
levels(sex)[1] <- "undetermined"
levels(sex)
head(sex)
```


> ### Challenge
>
> * Rename "F" and "M" to "female" and "male" respectively.
> * Now that we have renamed the factor level to "undetermined", can you recreate the
>  barplot such that "undetermined" is last (after "male")?
>
> ```{r, answer=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
> levels(sex)[2:3] <- c("female", "male")
> sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("female", "male", "undetermined"))
> plot(sex)
> ``` 


```{r wrong-order, results='show', echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
## Challenges
##
## * Rename "F" and "M" to "female" and "male" respectively.
## * Now that we have renamed the factor level to "undetermined", can you recreate the
##   barplot such that "undetermined" is last (after "male")
```


### Using `stringsAsFactors=FALSE`

By default, when building or importing a data frame, the columns that contain
characters (i.e. text) are coerced (= converted) into factors. Depending on what you want to do with the data, you may want to keep these
columns as `character`. To do so, `read.csv()` and `read.table()` have an
argument called `stringsAsFactors` which can be set to `FALSE`.

In most cases, it is preferable to set `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` when importing
data and to convert as a factor only the columns that require this data
type.


```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
## Compare the difference between our data read as `factor` vs `character`.
iris <- read.csv("data/iris.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
str(iris)
iris <- read.csv("data/iris.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(iris)
## Convert the column "species" into a factor
iris$species <- factor(iris$species)
```

The automatic conversion of data type is sometimes a blessing, sometimes an
annoyance. Be aware that it exists, learn the rules, and double check that data
you import in R are of the correct type within your data frame. If not, use it
to your advantage to detect mistakes that might have been introduced during data
entry (for instance, a letter in a column that should only contain numbers).

## Formatting Dates

One of the most common issues that new (and experienced!) R users have is
converting date and time information into a variable that is appropriate and
usable during analyses. As a reminder from earlier in this lesson, the best
practice for dealing with date data is to ensure that each component of your
date is stored as a separate variable. Using `str()`, We can confirm that our
data frame has a separate column for day, month, and year, and that each contains
integer values.

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
str(iris)
```
We are going to use the `ymd()` function from the package **`lubridate`** (which belongs to the **`tidyverse`**; learn more [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/)). . **`lubridate`** gets installed as part as the **`tidyverse`** installation. When you load  the **`tidyverse`** (`library(tidyverse)`), the core packages (the packages used in most data analyses) get loaded. **`lubridate`** however does not belong to the core tidyverse, so you have to load it explicitly with `library(lubridate)`

Start by loading the required package:

```{r load-package, message=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
```

`ymd()` takes a vector representing year, month, and day, and converts it to a
`Date` vector. `Date` is a class of data recognized by R as being a date and can
be manipulated as such. The argument that the function requires is flexible,
but, as a best practice, is a character vector formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD".


Let's create a date object and inspect the structure:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
my_date <- ymd("2015-01-01")
str(my_date)
```

Now let's paste the year, month, and day separately - we get the same result:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
# sep indicates the character to use to separate each component
my_date <- ymd(paste("2015", "1", "1", sep = "-")) 
str(my_date)
```

Now we apply this function to the iris dataset. Create a character vector from the `year`, `month`, and `day` columns of
`iris` using `paste()`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
paste(iris$year, iris$month, iris$day, sep = "-")
```

This character vector can be used as the argument for `ymd()`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
ymd(paste(iris$year, iris$month, iris$day, sep = "-"))
```

The resulting `Date` vector can be added to `iris` as a new column called `date`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
iris$date <- ymd(paste(iris$year, iris$month, iris$day, sep = "-"))
str(iris) # notice the new column, with 'date' as the class
```

Let's make sure everything worked correctly. One way to inspect the new column is to use `summary()`:

```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
summary(iris$date)
```

Something went wrong: some dates have missing values. Let's investigate where they are coming from.

We can use the functions we saw previously to deal with missing data to identify
the rows in our data frame that are failing. If we combine them with what we learned about subsetting data frames earlier, we can extract the columns "year, "month", "day" from the records that have `NA` in our new column `date`. We will also use `head()` so we don't clutter the output:

```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
missing_dates <- iris[is.na(iris$date), c("year", "month", "day")]

head(missing_dates)
```

Why did these dates fail to parse? If you had to use these data for your
analyses, how would you deal with this situation?
