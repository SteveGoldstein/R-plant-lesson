# Data Manipulation using **`dplyr`**

Bracket subsetting is handy, but it can be cumbersome and difficult to read, especially for complicated operations. **`dplyr`**. **`dplyr`** is a package for making tabular data manipulation easier.

Packages in R are basically sets of additional functions that let you do more stuff. The functions we've been using so far, like `str()` or `data.frame()`, come built into R; packages give you access to more of them. Before you use a package for the first time you need to install it on your machine, and then you should import it in every subsequent R session when you need it. 

You should already have installed the **`tidyverse`** package. This is an "umbrella-package" that installs several packages useful for data analysis which work together well such as **`tidyr`**, **`dplyr`**, **`ggplot2`**, **`tibble`**, etc.


The **`tidyverse`** package tries to address 3 common issues that arise when doing data analysis with some of the functions that come with R:

1. The results from a base R function sometimes depend on the type of data.

2. Using R expressions in a non standard way, which can be confusing for new learners.

3. Hidden arguments, having default operations that new learners are not aware of.

We have seen in our previous lesson that when building or importing a data frame, the columns that contain characters (i.e., text) are coerced (=converted) into the `factor` data type. We had to set **`stringsAsFactors`** to **`FALSE`** to avoid this hidden argument to convert our data type. 

This time we will use the **`tidyverse`** package to read the data and avoid having to set **`stringsAsFactors`** to **`FALSE`**

#### To load the tidyverse package set, including dplyr, type:


~~~
## load the tidyverse packages, including dplyr
library("tidyverse")
~~~
{: .language-r}

## What is **`dplyr`**?

The package **`dplyr`** provides easy tools for the most common data manipulation tasks like selecting columns, filtering rows, creating new columns, and creating summary tables. 

To learn more about **`dplyr`** after the workshop, you may want to check out this [handy data transformation with **`dplyr`** cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf).

We'll read in our data using the `read_csv()` function, from the tidyverse package **`readr`**, instead of `read.csv()`.


~~~
iris <- read_csv("data/iris.csv")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Parsed with column specification:
cols(
  Sepal.Length = col_double(),
  Sepal.Width = col_double(),
  Petal.Length = col_double(),
  Petal.Width = col_double(),
  Species = col_character()
)
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
## inspect the data

~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':	150 obs. of  5 variables:

  .. ..- attr(*, "class")= chr  "collector_guess" "collector"
  ..- attr(*, "class")= chr "col_spec"

To preview the data, you can click on the name of the tibble in your environment or use the `View` function. 


~~~
## preview the data
View(iris)
~~~
{: .language-r}
Either of these methods will open a window with the dataset in the same area as your script file.

#### Tibbles
Notice that the class of the data is now `tbl_df`

This is referred to as a "tibble". Tibbles tweak some of the behaviors of the data frame objects we introduced in the previous episode. The data structure is very similar to a data frame. For our purposes the only differences are that:

1. In addition to displaying the data type of each column under its name, it only prints the first few rows of data and only as many columns as fit on one screen.

2. Columns of class `character` are never converted into factors.


We're going to learn some of the most common **`dplyr`** functions:

- `select()`: subset columns
- `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
- `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other columns
- `group_by()` and `summarize()`: create summary statisitcs on grouped data
- `arrange()`: sort results
- `count()`: count discrete values

## Selecting columns and filtering rows

To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The first argument
to this function is the data frame (`iris`), and the subsequent
arguments are the columns to keep.


~~~
select(iris, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 150 x 2
   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width
          <dbl>       <dbl>
 1          5.1         3.5
 2          4.9         3  
 3          4.7         3.2
 4          4.6         3.1
 5          5           3.6
 6          5.4         3.9
 7          4.6         3.4
 8          5           3.4
 9          4.4         2.9
10          4.9         3.1
# … with 140 more rows
~~~
{: .output}


To select all columns *except* certain ones, put a "-" in front of
the variable to exclude it.


~~~
select(iris, -Sepal.Length, -Sepal.Width)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 150 x 3
   Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
          <dbl>       <dbl> <chr>  
 1          1.4         0.2 setosa 
 2          1.4         0.2 setosa 
 3          1.3         0.2 setosa 
 4          1.5         0.2 setosa 
 5          1.4         0.2 setosa 
 6          1.7         0.4 setosa 
 7          1.4         0.3 setosa 
 8          1.5         0.2 setosa 
 9          1.4         0.2 setosa 
10          1.5         0.1 setosa 
# … with 140 more rows
~~~
{: .output}

This will select all the variables in `iris` except `Sepal.Length`
and `Sepal.Width`.

To choose rows based on a specific criteria, use `filter()`:


~~~
filter(iris, Sepal.Length>5)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 118 x 5
   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
          <dbl>       <dbl>        <dbl>       <dbl> <chr>  
 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2 setosa 
 2          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4 setosa 
 3          5.4         3.7          1.5         0.2 setosa 
 4          5.8         4            1.2         0.2 setosa 
 5          5.7         4.4          1.5         0.4 setosa 
 6          5.4         3.9          1.3         0.4 setosa 
 7          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.3 setosa 
 8          5.7         3.8          1.7         0.3 setosa 
 9          5.1         3.8          1.5         0.3 setosa 
10          5.4         3.4          1.7         0.2 setosa 
# … with 108 more rows

## Pipes

What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three
ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.

With intermediate steps, you create a temporary data frame and use
that as input to the next function, like this:


~~~
iris2 <- filter(iris, Sepal.Length < 5)
iris_small <- select(iris2, Species, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)
~~~
{: .language-r}

This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of objects that you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that can be hard to keep track of.

You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another), like this:


~~~
iris_sml <- select(filter(iris, Sepal.Length < 5), Species, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)
~~~
{: .language-r}

This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested, as R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case, filtering, then selecting).

The last option, *pipes*, are a recent addition to R. Pipes let you take
the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful when you need to do many things to the same dataset.  Pipes in R look like `%>%` and are made available via the **`magrittr`** package, installed automatically with **`dplyr`**. If you use RStudio, you can type the pipe with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
+ <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a PC or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + 
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a Mac.


~~~
iris %>%
  filter(Sepal.Length < 5) %>%
  select(Species, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 22 x 3
   Species Sepal.Length Sepal.Width
   <chr>          <dbl>       <dbl>
 1 setosa           4.9         3  
 2 setosa           4.7         3.2
 3 setosa           4.6         3.1
 4 setosa           4.6         3.4
 5 setosa           4.4         2.9
 6 setosa           4.9         3.1
 7 setosa           4.8         3.4
 8 setosa           4.8         3  
 9 setosa           4.3         3  
10 setosa           4.6         3.6
# … with 12 more rows
~~~
{: .output}

In the above code, we use the pipe to send the `iris` dataset first through `filter()` to keep rows where `Sepal.Length` is less than 5, then through `select()` to keep only the `Sepal.Length`, `Sepal.Width`, and `species` columns. Since `%>%` takes the object on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on its right, we don't need to explicitly include the data frame as an argument to the `filter()` and `select()` functions any more.

Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word "then". For instance, in the above example, we took the data frame `iris`, *then* we `filter`ed for rows with `Sepal.Length < 5`, *then* we `select`ed columns `species`, `Sepal.Length`, and `Sepal.Width`. The **`dplyr`** functions by themselves are somewhat simple, but by combining them into linear workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish more complex manipulations of data frames.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data, we can assign it a new name:


~~~
iris_sml <- iris %>%
  filter(Sepal.Length < 5) %>%
  select(Species, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)

iris_sml
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 22 x 3
   Species Sepal.Length Sepal.Width
   <chr>          <dbl>       <dbl>
 1 setosa           4.9         3  
 2 setosa           4.7         3.2
 3 setosa           4.6         3.1
 4 setosa           4.6         3.4
 5 setosa           4.4         2.9
 6 setosa           4.9         3.1
 7 setosa           4.8         3.4
 8 setosa           4.8         3  
 9 setosa           4.3         3  
10 setosa           4.6         3.6
# … with 12 more rows
~~~
{: .output}

Note that the final data frame is the leftmost part of this expression.

### Introducing the a Plant Physiology Environmental dataset
While the iris dataset lets us illustrate many of the features of dplyr, it is not complex enough to illustrate all features. For the challenges and some examples in this lesson, we will be introducing a new dataset, `phys_dates` that is a variation on the `phys_data` dataset you will be using in the Advanced R lesson. 

<Insert Kim's description of the dataset here>

The only difference is that the date is represented as month, day, and year rather than year and day of year. 

> ## Challenge 1
>
>  Using pipes, subset the `phys_dates` data to include observations collected in

## Mutate

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the ratio of values in two columns. For this we'll use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of weight in kg:


~~~
iris %>%
  mutate(Sepal.Ratio = Sepal.Length/Sepal.Width)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 150 x 6
   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species Sepal.Ratio
          <dbl>       <dbl>        <dbl>       <dbl> <chr>         <dbl>
 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2 setosa         1.46
 2          4.9         3            1.4         0.2 setosa         1.63
 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2 setosa         1.47
 4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2 setosa         1.48
 5          5           3.6          1.4         0.2 setosa         1.39
 6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4 setosa         1.38
 7          4.6         3.4          1.4         0.3 setosa         1.35
 8          5           3.4          1.5         0.2 setosa         1.47
 9          4.4         2.9          1.4         0.2 setosa         1.52
10          4.9         3.1          1.5         0.1 setosa         1.58
# … with 140 more rows
~~~
{: .output}

You can also create a second new column based on the first new column within the same call of `mutate()`:


~~~
iris %>%
  mutate(Sepal.Ratio = Sepal.Length/Sepal.Width,
         Petal.Ratio = Petal.Length/Petal.Width)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

## Exporting data

Now that you have learned how to use **`dplyr`** to extract information from
or summarize your raw data, you may want to export these new data sets to share
them with your collaborators or for archival.

Similar to the `read_csv()` function used for reading CSV files into R, there is
a `write_csv()` function that generates CSV files from data frames.

Before using `write_csv()`, we are going to create a new folder, `data_output`,
in our working directory that will store this generated dataset. We don't want
to write generated datasets in the same directory as our raw data. It's good
practice to keep them separate. The `data` folder should only contain the raw,
unaltered data, and should be left alone to make sure we don't delete or modify
it. In contrast, our script will generate the contents of the `data_output`
directory, so even if the files it contains are deleted, we can always
re-generate them.

We can save it as a CSV file in a new folder called `data_output` folder.
Let's save the dataset that that we created dates in.


~~~
write_csv(phys_dates, path = "data_output/phys_dates.csv")
~~~
{: .language-r}

## Split-apply-combine data analysis and the summarize() function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the *split-apply-combine* paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and then combine the results. **`dplyr`** makes this very easy through the use of the `group_by()` function.

### The `summarize()` function

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()`, which collapses each group into a single-row summary of that group.  `group_by()` takes as arguments the column names that contain the **categorical** variables for which you want to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute the mean `Sepal.Length` by `Species`:


~~~

You can also group by multiple columns. For this, we'll need to use the `phys_dates` dataset:


~~~
phys_dates %>%
  group_by(Year, Species) %>%
  summarize(mean_photo = mean(Photo))
~~~
{: .language-r}

If you want to display more data, you can use the `print()` function
at the end of your chain with the argument `n` specifying the number of rows to display:


~~~
phys_dates %>%  
  group_by(Year, Species) %>%
  summarize(mean_photo = mean(Photo)) %>% 
  print(n = 15)

Once the data are grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at the same time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance, we could add a column indicating the minimum photosynthesis level by year and species:


~~~
phys_dates %>%
  group_by(Year, Species) %>%
  summarize(mean_photo = mean(Photo),
            min_photo = min(Photo))
~~~
{: .language-r}

It is sometimes useful to rearrange the result of a query to inspect the values. For instance, we can sort on `min_photo` to put the less photosynthetic first:


~~~
phys_dates %>%
  group_by(Year, Species) %>%
  summarize(mean_photo = mean(Photo),
            min_photo = min(Photo)) %>%
  arrange(min_photo)

To sort in descending order, we need to add the `desc()` function. If we want to sort the results by decreasing order of minimum photosynthesis:


~~~
phys_dates %>%
  group_by(Year, Species) %>%
  summarize(mean_photo = mean(Photo),
            min_photo = min(Photo)) %>%
  arrange(desc(min_photo))

### Counting

When working with data, we often want to know the number of observations found for each factor or combination of factors. For this task, **`dplyr`** provides `count()`. For example, if we wanted to count the number of rows of data for each species, we would do:


~~~
iris %>%
    count(Species) 
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 3 x 2
  Species        n
  <chr>      <int>
1 setosa        50
2 versicolor    50
3 virginica     50
~~~
{: .output}

The `count()` function is shorthand for something we've already seen: grouping by a variable, and summarizing it by counting the number of observations in that group. In other words, `iris %>% count()` is equivalent to:  


~~~
iris %>%
    group_by(Species) %>%
    summarise(count = n())
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 3 x 2
  Species    count
  <chr>      <int>
1 setosa        50
2 versicolor    50
3 virginica     50
~~~
{: .output}

If we wanted to count *combination of factors*, such as `Species` and `Year`, we would specify the first and the second factor as the arguments of `count()`:


~~~
phys_dates %>%
  count(Year, Species) 
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 16 x 3
    Year Species     n
   <int> <chr>   <int>

 2  2014 AG         18
 3  2014 CD         18
 4  2014 PV         18
 5  2014 RG         18
 6  2014 SC         18
 7  2014 SN         15
 8  2014 VB         18
 9  2015 AC         18
10  2015 AG         18
11  2015 CD         18
12  2015 PV         18
13  2015 RG         18

15  2015 SN         18
16  2015 VB         15
~~~
{: .output}

With the above code, we can proceed with `arrange()` to sort the table 
according to a number of criteria so that we have a better comparison. 
For instance, we might want to arrange the table above in (i) an alphabetical order of 
the levels of the species and (ii) in descending order of the count:


~~~
phys_dates %>%
  count(Year, Species) %>%
  arrange(Species, desc(n))
~~~
{: .language-r}
